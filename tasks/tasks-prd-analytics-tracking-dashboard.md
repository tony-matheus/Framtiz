### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The analytics dashboard will be integrated into the existing admin layout and navigation system.
- All components should follow the existing cyber-themed UI patterns used in the admin section.
- The page tracker component should be added to the home page, blogs listing page, and individual blog post pages.
